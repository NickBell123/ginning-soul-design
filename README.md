## Technologies Used

This site was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.

I made use of [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/) grid system for responsive picture and page layouts. Various styling and spacing classes were used to achieve the sites framework as a whole.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Specifically Lobster and Comfortaa font families where used in the typography of the site.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to provide social icon images.

## TESTING

Though the process of building the site, I made use of deveopment tool through Chrome to ensure responsiveness accross all screen sizes.

Links, both navagation and external have been tried and tested as well as social. Contact me page form has been tested.
  
A use should find the site easy and simple to use with little to no confusion (minus the Lorem).

I used the Github page link to test accross several browser types (Chrome, Explorer, Safari, Mollzilla Firefox and Opera) and all worked well.

I have notice an issue with the text in the navbar on some browsers. This maybe a CSS styling issue that I will look into.

There was a huge amount of trial and error involved in the development of the webpages. Working with large images was tricky but after researching flexbox modal it was much simpler.

I used media quiries to adjust the font text on smaller devices so the Titles became larger. The text was too small on mobile screens and barley visable.

There were many simlar adjustments across the project.

## Deployment

This site was developed using VScode IDE. All changes to the code were then added and committed to the local repository. The commits were then pushed to my GitHub repository and the project deployed using GtiHub pages as follows;

Step 1: Go to the settings tab of the repo, scrolled down to GitHub Pages

Step 2: Under GitHub Pages -> Source is a scrolldown box titled None. Click it and you can select a source.

Step 3: Click master branch

Step 4: You will be automatically taken to the top of the page where in a light blue bar will be stated "Github Pages source saved".

Step 5: You then scroll down to GitHub Pages where will be stated "Your site is ready to be published at "<https://nickbell123.github.io/ginning-soul-design/">

Step 6: Click on the url and you will be auto-referred to the published webpage.

Step 7: When returning to the github repository settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and you will see a light green block stating "Your site is published at <https://...">
