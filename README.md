## Technologies Used
This site was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.

I made use of [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/) grid system for responsive picture and page layouts. Various styling and spacing classes were used to achieve the sites framework as a whole. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Specifically Lobster and Comfortaa font families where used in the typography of the site.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to provide social icon images.


Though the process of building the site, I made use of deveopment tool through Chrome to ensure responsiveness accross all screen sizes.

Links, both navagation and external have been tried and tested as well as social. Contact me page form has been tested.
  
A use should find the site easy and simple to use with little to no confusion (minus the Lorem).

## Deployment

This site was hosted thrugh Github pages after delevopment using VS code and Chrome Dev Tools.

## Credits

### Content
Lorem Ipsum text was used in the About me page (mission statement) to give an idea of what the designer might want to do or could lay things out.

I also used it as an exmape for product infomation an the modals used in the gallary page.

This was due to a lack of knowledge of product info and lack of time.
